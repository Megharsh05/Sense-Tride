# 🦯 Sense-Stride

**Sense-Stride** is a smart assistive walking cane designed to improve mobility and safety for visually impaired individuals. It combines time-of-flight sensors, a motion detector, and haptic feedback to detect and alert the user of nearby obstacles in all directions. Built using an STM32H563ZI microcontroller, it offers enhanced spatial awareness while remaining lightweight and user-friendly.
